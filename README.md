# final

This repository contains my final project in SoftServe Academy. 
I used Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Also, I have used the following tools from AWS:

  - Load balancer;
  - ECS & ECR;
  - CodeBuild;
  - S3 bucket;
  - IAM roles;
  - NAT & Internet Gateways;
  - VPC;
  - Public & private subnets;
